# ATC

## Problem

There are thousands of flights every day and it would be too overwhelming for aircraft pilots to communicate with every other plane about who gets to land their plane next.

## Solution

Air Traffic Control (ATC) is the solution.

The control tower serves as a **mediator** between flights and its only purpose is to enforce constraints on who can take off or land next. It is also worth noting the ATC does not control the whole flight, but rather notifies aircrafts on how to proceed.
